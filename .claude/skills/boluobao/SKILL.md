# Boluobao for Claude Code

This file is the Claude Code project bridge. The repository root remains the single source of truth so Codex and Claude Code cannot drift into different visual systems.

1. Read the canonical [SKILL.md](../../../SKILL.md) completely before acting.
2. Resolve every relative link in the canonical file against the repository root, then read only the references required for the active mode.
3. Follow the canonical planning, generation, correction, quality-scoring, naming, and final-only delivery contract without weakening it.

## Claude Code runtime adaptation

- Use an image-generation or image-editing tool configured in the current Claude Code environment when the task requires pixels.
- If no compatible image tool is available, complete the content map, composition brief, locked text, production prompt, and verification plan, then clearly state that image execution was not performed. Never invent a generated file or path.
- Treat `agents/openai.yaml` as Codex-only interface metadata. It does not modify the visual rules.
- Keep accepted final artwork outside the installed Skill directory and do not retain candidate or correction images.

Invoke explicitly with `/boluobao`, or let Claude Code select the Skill automatically from the description above.
